Evaluate the lighting effectiveness on the cat subject in a photograph. Score how well the light reveals the cat — whether the cat's key features (face, eyes, fur texture, color, and body form) are visible and legible to the viewer.

Effective lighting means the cat can be seen clearly and naturally, regardless of the light source. Soft window light, overcast sky glow, or the warm spill of a table lamp can all score well if they make the cat readable. What matters is that the light reaches the subject and makes its features discernible.

Score poorly when lighting fails the subject:
- Overexposure that washes the cat into a featureless white shape, destroying fur texture and facial definition
- Underexposure that buries the cat in darkness, making the viewer strain to see the subject
- Extreme contrast that splits the cat into zones of blinding brightness and impenetrable shadow, preventing the animal from being appreciated as a whole
- Unnatural color casts (sickly greens from fluorescent bulbs, aggressive orange from tungsten) that distort the cat's true appearance

Score highly when lighting serves the subject:
- The cat's face is clearly visible — eyes, nose, whiskers, and expression are legible
- Fur texture, color, and patterns can be seen and appreciated
- The cat's body form and posture are perceptible within the frame
- The light feels natural and appropriate, neither too harsh nor too dim

This is a purely functional evaluation. The question is not whether the lighting is artistic or dramatic, but whether it lets a viewer look at the photograph and understand what the cat looks like. A humble lamp that clearly illuminates the cat should outscore dramatic golden-hour light that overexposes or casts confusing shadows across the subject.
