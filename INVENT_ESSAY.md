## Purpose

A photograph of a cat is, at its most basic, an attempt to show someone what a cat looks like. Before any consideration of composition, mood, or artistry, a photograph must first succeed at this humble task: letting the viewer see the cat. Lighting is the mechanism by which this happens. It is the invisible hand that either reveals the subject or obscures it. The purpose of cat-subject-lighting-score is to evaluate whether the lighting in a photograph does its fundamental job — making the cat visible, legible, and whole to the person looking at the image.

This is not an evaluation of photographic artistry. A moody silhouette may be a beautiful photograph, but if the viewer cannot discern the cat's face, fur, or form, the lighting has not served the subject. Conversely, a simple snapshot taken under a kitchen ceiling light, where the cat is plainly and fully visible, has succeeded. The function asks one central question: can a viewer look at this photograph and understand what the cat looks like? Everything flows from that question.

The value of this function lies in its indifference to style and its devotion to clarity. It does not care whether the light source is a grand bay window or a modest desk lamp. It does not reward drama for its own sake or penalize simplicity. It rewards light that reaches the cat and makes the cat knowable to the viewer.

## Input

The function receives a single photograph containing a cat as its subject. This photograph can come from any source and any context — a carefully composed portrait from a professional camera, a casual snapshot from a phone, a rescue shelter's intake photo, or a listing image from a breeder. The lighting conditions may range from bright natural daylight to dim indoor lamplight, from overcast outdoor softness to the sharp artificial glow of a flash. What unites all inputs is that they contain a cat, and the function's task is to evaluate how well the light in that specific image serves that specific cat.

The photograph is taken as-is. The function does not consider what the photographer intended or what equipment was used. It looks only at the result — the image as it exists — and evaluates the relationship between the light present in the scene and the visibility of the cat within it.

## Use-Cases

The applications of this function are broad precisely because its concern is so fundamental. Anyone who needs to assess whether a cat is clearly shown in a photograph has a use for it.

For animal shelters and rescue organizations, clear photographs of cats directly influence adoption rates. A potential adopter scrolling through listings needs to see the cat — its face, its coloring, its personality as expressed through posture and expression. A photo where the cat is lost in shadow or bleached by overexposure fails that cat. This function could help shelters identify which photos actually show their animals well and which need to be retaken.

For veterinary telemedicine and remote consultations, a veterinarian reviewing a photo of a cat needs to see the animal's physical condition. Fur quality, body shape, visible features — these are diagnostic inputs. Lighting that obscures them makes the photo clinically useless, regardless of how well-intentioned the pet owner was when they took it.

For breeders, cat registries, and online marketplaces, photographs serve as a visual record and a first impression. Buyers, judges, and enthusiasts need to see breed-specific features, coat patterns, and physical conformation. Lighting that distorts color, hides texture, or fragments the body into patches of light and dark undermines the photograph's purpose entirely.

In each of these cases, the function provides a simple, consistent answer: does the light in this image let you see the cat?

## Three Qualities of Evaluation

The function evaluates three distinct qualities of the photograph, each representing a different dimension of how light reveals a cat to a viewer.

### 1. Facial Legibility

The face is where a viewer's eye goes first. It is the seat of the cat's identity and expression — the eyes, the nose, the whiskers, the set of the ears, the subtle geometry of the mouth. When we look at a photograph of a cat, we look at the face to understand who this animal is. Lighting must serve this instinct.

Facial legibility asks whether the light in the photograph allows a viewer to clearly see the cat's facial features. Can you make out both eyes? Is the nose defined? Are the whiskers visible against their background? Can you read the cat's expression — whether it is alert, relaxed, curious, or sleepy?

Light fails facial legibility when it overexposes the face into a flat white shape, when it casts one half of the face into impenetrable shadow, or when it creates such extreme contrast across the features that the face becomes a fractured puzzle of bright spots and dark voids. Light succeeds when the face is evenly and naturally illuminated — when the viewer can look at it and feel that they have seen the cat, not just a shape where a cat's face should be.

This quality carries particular weight because a photograph in which the cat's body is visible but the face is lost will always feel incomplete to a viewer. The face is the anchor of the subject.

### 2. Fur and Color Fidelity

A cat's coat is one of its most defining visual characteristics. The color, the pattern, the texture — whether it is the dense plush of a British Shorthair, the wild tabby striping of a barn cat, or the smoky gradients of a Russian Blue — these are things a viewer wants to see and appreciate. Lighting must reveal them truthfully.

Fur and color fidelity asks whether the light in the photograph allows the viewer to perceive the cat's coat as it actually is. Can you see the texture of the fur — whether it is short and sleek, long and flowing, or somewhere in between? Are the colors accurate, or has the light source imposed an unnatural cast — sickly green from fluorescent tubes, aggressive orange from uncorrected tungsten, or the sterile blue-white of a bare LED? Are patterns like stripes, spots, or points visible and distinct, or have they been flattened by overexposure or swallowed by underexposure?

This quality is especially important because color and texture are often the very reason the photograph exists. A shelter wants to show that a cat is orange tabby, not ambiguously brown. A breeder wants to document a precise coat pattern. A pet owner sharing a photo wants others to see what makes their cat beautiful. When lighting distorts or erases these qualities, it betrays the purpose of the image.

Light succeeds here when fur looks tangible — when a viewer could imagine running their hand across it and knowing what it would feel like. It fails when the coat becomes a featureless mass, a blown-out highlight, or a murky shadow that could belong to any animal.

### 3. Body Form and Wholeness

A cat is not just a face and a coat. It is a physical animal with a posture, a shape, and a presence within the frame. The way a cat holds itself — whether it is curled into a tight ball, stretched out in a sunbeam, or sitting upright with quiet dignity — tells the viewer something about the animal. Lighting must make this legible.

Body form and wholeness asks whether the light in the photograph allows the viewer to perceive the cat as a complete, coherent subject. Can you see the full extent of the cat that is within the frame? Can you distinguish the cat's body from the background? Is the animal's posture and physical form — its size, its proportions, the way its limbs are arranged — visible and understandable?

Light fails body form when extreme contrast splits the cat into disconnected islands of visibility, when the cat's body merges into a dark background because there is insufficient light to separate them, or when overexposure erases the boundaries of the cat's form against a bright background. In these cases, the viewer sees fragments rather than an animal. The cat becomes an abstraction.

Light succeeds when the cat reads as a whole being within the photograph — when the viewer can trace the outline of the animal, understand its posture, and appreciate it as a complete subject rather than assembling it mentally from scattered visual clues. The cat does not need to be separated from its environment with studio precision; it simply needs to be perceptible as a distinct, whole creature within the frame.

This quality matters because a photograph that captures a clear face and beautiful fur but loses the body to shadow or blowout still feels partial. The viewer is left with an incomplete picture, and the photograph has not fully done its job.

## Conclusion

These three qualities — facial legibility, fur and color fidelity, and body form and wholeness — together form a complete evaluation of whether lighting has served the cat as a photographic subject. They move from the most intimate and identity-defining feature (the face), through the cat's most visually distinctive attribute (its coat), to the animal as a complete physical presence (its body). A photograph that scores well across all three has done the essential work: it has shown someone a cat, clearly and honestly, through the simple grace of adequate light.
