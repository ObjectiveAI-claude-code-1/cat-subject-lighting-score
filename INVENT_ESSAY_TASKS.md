1. Evaluate facial legibility by examining whether the lighting allows a viewer to clearly see the cat's facial features. Assess whether the eyes, nose, whiskers, ears, and overall expression are visible and discernible. Light that evenly illuminates the face so that a viewer can identify who this cat is scores well. Light that overexposes the face into a flat white shape, buries half the face in impenetrable shadow, or fractures the features into disconnected bright spots and dark voids scores poorly. The face is the anchor of the subject — a photograph where the body is visible but the face is lost will always feel incomplete.

2. Evaluate fur and color fidelity by examining whether the lighting reveals the cat's coat truthfully. Assess whether the texture of the fur is perceivable — whether it reads as short and sleek, long and flowing, or somewhere in between. Assess whether the colors appear natural and accurate or whether the light source has imposed an unnatural cast such as green from fluorescent lighting, orange from tungsten, or harsh blue-white from bare LEDs. Assess whether coat patterns like stripes, spots, or points are visible and distinct rather than flattened by overexposure or swallowed by underexposure. Light that makes the fur look tangible and the colors believable scores well. Light that reduces the coat to a featureless mass or distorts its true appearance scores poorly.

3. Evaluate body form and wholeness by examining whether the lighting allows the viewer to perceive the cat as a complete, coherent physical subject within the frame. Assess whether the cat's body is distinguishable from the background and whether its posture, size, proportions, and the arrangement of its limbs are visible and understandable. Light that lets the viewer trace the outline of the animal and read it as a whole being scores well. Light that splits the cat into disconnected islands of visibility through extreme contrast, merges the cat's body into a dark background through insufficient illumination, or erases the boundaries of the cat's form against a bright background through overexposure scores poorly. The cat must read as a distinct, whole creature within the photograph.
